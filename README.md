## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g opencode-orchestrator
```

Inside an OpenCode environment:
```bash
/task "Implement a new authentication module with JWT and audit logs"
```

## 🚀 Engine Workflow

OpenCode Orchestrator utilizes a **Hub-and-Spoke Topology** with **Work-Stealing Queues** to execute complex engineering tasks through parallel, context-isolated sessions.

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

### 🔒 Atomic MVCC State Synchronization
The engine solves the "Concurrent TODO Update" problem using **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) + Mutex**. Agents can safely mark tasks as complete in parallel without data loss or race conditions. Every state change is cryptographically hashed and logged for a complete audit trail.

### 🧩 Advanced Hook Orchestration
Execution flows are governed by a **Priority-Phase Hook Registry**. Hooks (Safety, UI, Protocol) are grouped into phases (`early`, `normal`, `late`) and executed using a **Topological Sort** to handle complex dependencies automatically, ensuring a predictable and stable environment.

### 🛡️ Autonomous Recovery
- **Self-healing loops** with adaptive stagnation detection
- **Proactive Agency**: Smart monitoring that audits logs and plans ahead during background tasks
- **Auto-retry with backoff**: Exponential backoff for transient failures

### 🎯 State-Level Session Isolation
Reused sessions in the **SessionPool** are explicitly reset using server-side compaction triggered by health monitors. This ensures that previous task context (old error messages, stale file references) never leaks into new tasks, maintaining 100% implementation integrity.

### 🚀 Zero-Payload Turbo Mode
Leverages `system.transform` to unshift massive agent instruction sets on the server side. This reduces initial message payloads by **90%+**, slashing latency and preventing context fragmentation during long autonomous loops.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Reliability

### 🔒 Resource Safety & Reliability
- **RAII Pattern (ConcurrencyToken)**: Guaranteed resource cleanup with zero leaks
- **ShutdownManager**: Priority-based graceful shutdown with 5-second timeout per handler
- **Automatic Backups**: All config changes backed up with rollback support
- **Atomic File Operations**: Temp file + rename for corruption-proof writes
- **Finally Blocks**: Guaranteed cleanup in all critical paths
- **Zero Resource Leaks**: File watchers, event listeners, concurrency slots all properly released

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Work-Stealing Queues**: Chase-Lev deque implementation for 90%+ CPU utilization
  - Planner: 2 workers, Worker: 8 workers, Reviewer: 4 workers
  - LIFO for owner (cache locality), FIFO for thieves (fairness)
- **Memory Pooling**: 80% GC pressure reduction
  - Object Pool: 200 ParallelTask instances (50 prewarmed)
  - String Interning: Deduplication for agent names, status strings
  - Buffer Pool: Reusable ArrayBuffers (1KB, 4KB, 16KB, 64KB)
- **Session Reuse**: 90% faster session creation (500ms → 50ms)
  - Pool size: 5 sessions per agent type
  - Max reuse: 10 times per session
  - Health check: Every 60 seconds
- **Rust Connection Pool**: 10x faster tool calls (50-100ms → 5-10ms)
  - Max 4 persistent processes
  - 30-second idle timeout
- **Adaptive Polling**: Dynamic 500ms-5s intervals based on system load

### 🛡️ Safety Features
- **Circuit Breaker**: Auto-recovery from API failures (5 failures → open)
- **Resource Pressure Detection**: Rejects low-priority tasks when memory > 80%
- **Terminal Node Guard**: Prevents infinite recursion (depth limit enforcement)
- **Auto-Scaling**: Concurrency slots adjust based on success/failure rate

## 🛠️ Key Innovations

### 🧠 Hierarchical Memory System
Maintains focus across thousands of conversation turns using a 4-tier memory structure and **EMA-based Context Gating** to preserve "Architectural Truth" while pruning operational noise.

###  Dynamic Concurrency Auto-Scaling
Slots for parallel implementation scale up automatically after a **3-success streak** and scale down aggressively upon detection of API instability or implementation failures.

### 🛡️ Neuro-Symbolic Safety
Combines LLM reasoning with deterministic **AST/LSP verification**. Every code change is verified by native system tools before being accepted into the master roadmap.

### 🔄 Adaptive Intelligence Loop
- **Stagnation Detection**: Automatically senses when no progress is made across multiple iterations
- **Diagnostic Intervention**: Forces the agent into a "Diagnostic Mode" when stagnation is detected, mandating log audits and strategy pivots
- **Proactive Agency**: Mandates Speculative Planning and Parallel Thinking during background task execution

### 📊 Native TUI Integration
Seamless integration with OpenCode's native TUI via **TaskToastManager**. Provides non-intrusive, real-time feedback on **Mission Progress**, active **Agent Sub-sessions**, and **Technical Metrics** using protocol-safe Toast notifications.

### ⚡ Event-Driven Architecture
Utilizes a hybrid event-driven pipeline (`EventHandler` + `TaskPoller`) to maximize responsiveness while maintaining robust state tracking and resource cleanup.

### 🔒 Secure Configuration
Runtime agent configuration is strictly validated using **Zod schemas**, ensuring that custom agent definitions in `agents.json` are type-safe and error-free before execution.
